Task 1: Basic Lead Capture and Scoring
            Step 1: Create a Lead Capture Form
            Go to Google Forms and create a form with the fields:
            
            Company Size (Dropdown: 1-50, 51-200, 201-1000, 1000+ employees)
            Annual Budget for SaaS Solutions (Dropdown: < $10k, $10k-$50k, etc.)
            Industry (Dropdown: Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Other)
            Urgency of Need (Dropdown: Immediate, Short-term, Medium-term, Long-term)
            Comments (Optional for Task 3)
            Publish the form and ensure responses are linked to a Google Sheets spreadsheet.
            
            Step 2: Set Up Zapier Workflow
            Trigger: New Form Submission
            
            Log into Zapier and create a new Zap.
            Add Google Forms as the trigger app.
            Select New Response in Spreadsheet as the event.
            Connect your Google Forms account and select the response sheet.
            Action 1: Calculate Lead Score
            
            Add the Zapier Formatter action.
            Use a Number field to calculate the lead score:
            Assign points based on the values in the form (e.g., Company Size, Annual Budget).
            Action 2: Add Lead to Google Sheets
            
            Add Google Sheets as the action.
            Select Add Row to Spreadsheet.
            Map the lead details and calculated score to a new row in the sheet.
            Action 3: Conditional Actions
            
            Add Path A (High Score):
            Condition: Lead score > 70.
            Action: Send a welcome email using Gmail.
            Add Path B (Low Score):
            Condition: Lead score <= 70.
            Action: Add the lead to a separate Nurturing Campaign Spreadsheet.
            Deliverable:
            Take a screenshot of this Zap setup with all steps visible.
Task 2: Handling Edge Cases
            Step 1: Handle Incomplete Data
            Add a Filter action:
            Use the Zapier Filter app to check for missing or empty fields.
            If fields like Company Size or Annual Budget are blank:
            Send an email via Gmail requesting the missing details.
            Add the lead to a "Pending Information" Google Sheet.
            Step 2: Ensure High-Value Leads Are Managed
            Add another Filter action to identify high-value leads:
            Filter leads with a score > 80.
            Notify the sales team:
            Use Gmail to send an email with lead details.
            Add the lead to a High-Priority Leads Sheet.
            Step 3: Accommodate Different Time Zones
            Add Zapier Formatter to parse the timestamp and convert it to the lead’s time zone.
            Add a conditional step:
            Schedule follow-up actions in the lead’s time zone.
Task 3: Scaling and Advanced Implementation
            Step 1: Lead Distribution
            Use Zapier Formatter or Google Sheets formulas to:
            Assign leads evenly to sales reps using a round-robin algorithm.
            Update the "Assigned Sales Rep" column in the spreadsheet.
            Step 2: Keyword Extraction
            Use Zapier Formatter with the Text Extract action:
            Analyze the Comments field in the form.
            Extract keywords (e.g., "Budget", "Urgent").
            Add these keywords to a new column in the Google Sheet for categorization.
            Step 3: Create Follow-Up System
            Use Google Calendar:
            Add an action to create calendar events for follow-ups.
            Include the lead’s name, score, and follow-up notes in the event description.
            Schedule events based on urgency:
            Immediate: Within 1 day.
            Short-term: Within 3 days.
            Medium-term: Within 7 days.
            Long-term: Within 14 days.
